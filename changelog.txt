v0.0.2

- fval and cluster coordinates are saved to data npz archive as a whole, and the ignoring
  from start and stride are only applied after reading. This means the archive files made with
  v0.0.1 must be reloaded.
  Before this change the extraction was broken when the tsrting frame or stride were not the defaults.
- beginning and stride in extraction are taken from config by default.
- max height for choices can be given in config
