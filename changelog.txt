v0.0.2

- fval and cluster coordinates are saved to data npz archive as a whole, and the ignoring
  from start and stride are only applied after reading. This means the archive files made with
  v0.0.1 must be reloaded.
  Before this change the extraction was broken when the starting frame or stride were not the defaults.
- beginning and stride in extraction are taken from config by default.
- max height for choices can be given in config

v0.0.3

- Bugfix: The templates folder was not being installed properly
- Clustering figures imporved: title includes fval range and the chosen clusters will be shown. The changes in aic and bic are no longer plotted.
- The copied configs include the default values at the end. The "prelog" part also includes the command line call.
- The rng seed can be given in config
- Changed the way multiple starting structures are handled. Now they can be given as a list in config.
