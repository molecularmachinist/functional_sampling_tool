##################### EXPLANATIONS #####################

All the parameters can be given in this file [-f] or by command line options.
Command line options override parameters set in this file.

Input file	[-i]

Output file	[-o]

Parameters file	[-f]	=	The file to read the parameters from i.e. this file.

res_name	[-rn]	=	Name of the residues that are to be removed.

first_atom	[-ra]	=	Name of the first atom of the residue in the .gro file.
				This atom is used to determine whether the whole residue
				is inside the membrane or not.

res_size	[-rs]	=	Number of the atoms in that residue.

lipid_name	[-ln]	=	Name of the membrane lipid.

lim_atom	[-la]	=	The atom of the residue lipid_name that is used to calculate
				the average z component of the upper and the lower leaflets.

adjust_low	[-al]	=	Manual adjusting of lower leaflet. Positive number moves the
				border closer to the middle of the membrane.

adjust_high	[-ah]	=	Manual adjusting of upper leaflet. Positive number moves the
				border closer to the middle of the membrane.
